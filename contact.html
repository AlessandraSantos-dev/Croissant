      Croissants are dam difficult to make! Here are a few tips to make a good
      croissant!
    </h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Bubbles and leaks: It's not unusual to have air trapped inside your
        laminated dough. If this happens, simply pop the bubble with a toothpick
        and press the dough down to lie flat.
      </li>
      <li>
        If there's a bare spot where butter is coming through, dust the leak
        with flour, pressing down lightly so it sticks, and continue on with the
        fold.
      </li>
      <li>Refrigerate the dough as soon as the fold is done, to firm it up.</li>
      <li>
        As you work, keep the dough, work surface, and your rolling pin well
        dusted with flour. Turn over the dough from time to time. As you roll,
        you tend to expand the top layers more than the bottom. By flipping the
        dough over, you'll even that out.
      </li>
      <li>
        Before folding the dough over on itself, use your pastry brush to sweep
        off excess flour. This will help the dough stick to itself after
        folding, so the layers don't slide around.
      </li>
      <li>
        When rolling the dough, especially for the first time, be sure the dough
        and butter are at the same consistency; this will make rolling much
        smoother and the layers will be more even.
      </li>
    </ul>
