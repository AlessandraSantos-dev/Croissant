      Croissants are dam difficult to make! Here are a few tips to make a good
      croissant!

      Bubbles and leaks: It's not unusual to have air trapped inside your
      laminated dough. If this happens, simply pop the bubble with a toothpick
      and press the dough down to lie flat. If there's a bare spot where butter
      is coming through, dust the leak with flour, pressing down lightly so it
      sticks, and continue on with the fold. Refrigerate the dough as soon as
      the fold is done, to firm it up. As you work, keep the dough, work
      surface, and your rolling pin well dusted with flour. Turn over the dough
      from time to time. As you roll, you tend to expand the top layers more
      than the bottom. By flipping the dough over, you'll even that out. Before
      folding the dough over on itself, use your pastry brush to sweep off
      excess flour. This will help the dough stick to itself after folding, so
      the layers don't slide around. When rolling the dough, especially for the
      first time, be sure the dough and butter are at the same consistency; this
      will make rolling much smoother and the layers will be more even. To make
      Danish from this dough, add 1/2 teaspoon ground cardamom, 1/4 teaspoon
      nutmeg, and 1/8 teaspoon of ground cloves to the dough when mixing.
      Proceed with the rest of the recipe as shown until the dough is finished.
      You can make rectangular, filled croissants, too. See our blog for step by
      step instructions on how to do this. Fill croissants with ham and cheese,
      spinach, or use our pain au chocolate sticks for a special treat.
